Manage dependencies intelligently for the current project.

Steps:
1. Detect package manager and read dependencies:
   - Check for package.json (npm/yarn/pnpm)
   - Check for Cargo.toml (Rust)
   - Check for go.mod (Go)
   - Check for requirements.txt/Pipfile (Python)
   - Check for pom.xml/build.gradle (Java)
   - Check for deno.json (Deno)

2. Security audit:
   - Run security audit command for the package manager
   - Identify packages with known vulnerabilities
   - Check CVE databases for critical issues
   - Prioritize by severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
   - Suggest safe version upgrades

3. Outdated packages analysis:
   - List all outdated dependencies
   - Categorize by update type (patch/minor/major)
   - Check breaking changes in changelogs
   - Identify packages that haven't been updated in >1 year
   - Flag unmaintained packages

4. Unused dependencies:
   - Scan codebase for actual usage
   - Identify dependencies never imported
   - Find dev dependencies in production
   - Check for duplicate functionality packages
   - Calculate size impact of unused packages

5. Dependency optimization:
   - Suggest lighter alternatives (e.g., date-fns vs moment)
   - Identify packages that can be replaced with native code
   - Find opportunities to reduce bundle size
   - Recommend tree-shakeable alternatives
   - Check for polyfills no longer needed

6. Update strategy:
   - Create staged update plan (security > patch > minor > major)
   - Generate update commands with specific versions
   - Include rollback commands
   - Document testing requirements for each update
   - Create PR-ready update batches

7. License compliance:
   - Check all dependency licenses
   - Flag incompatible licenses
   - Identify copyleft licenses requiring attention

Output format:
- Executive summary with risk score
- Categorized list of issues
- Specific remediation commands
- Testing checklist
- Estimated effort and risk for updates
