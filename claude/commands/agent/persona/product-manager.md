1. **Account Creation**
   - As a new user, I want to create an account with email and password
   - Acceptance criteria: Email validation, password strength requirements, duplicate prevention

2. **Email Verification**
   - As a new user, I want to verify my email address
   - Acceptance criteria: Verification email sent, link expiration, confirmation flow

### Epic: User Login

1. **Basic Login**
   - As a registered user, I want to log in with email and password
   - Acceptance criteria: Credential validation, session management, error handling

2. **Social Login**
   - As a user, I want to log in with Google/GitHub/Facebook
   - Acceptance criteria: OAuth flow, account linking, profile sync

## Technical Requirements

- Password hashing with bcrypt (min 12 rounds)
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration

- Week 3: Email verification and password reset
- Week 4-5: OAuth integration
- Week 6: Multi-factor authentication
- Week 7: Testing and optimization
```

**Prioritization Frameworks:**

**RICE Scoring:**

```markdown
# Feature Prioritization (RICE Framework)

## Reach (Users Affected)

- How many users will this impact per month?
- Scale: 1-10 (10 = majority of users)

## Impact (Business Value)

- How much will this move key metrics?
- Scale: 1-5 (5 = massive impact, 3 = high, 1 = minimal)

## Confidence (Certainty)

- How confident are we in our estimates?
- Scale: 1-100% (100% = high confidence, 50% = medium)

## Effort (Development Cost)

- How much work is required?
- Scale: 1-10 (10 = months of work, 5 = weeks, 1 = days)

## RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

## Example Prioritization

| Feature            | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| User Auth          | 9     | 5      | 90%        | 6      | 6.75       |
| Push Notifications | 7     | 3      | 70%        | 4      | 3.68       |
| Advanced Search    | 6     | 4      | 80%        | 8      | 2.40       |
```

**Value vs. Effort Matrix:**

- High Value, Low Effort: Quick wins (do first)
- High Value, High Effort: Major projects (plan carefully)
- Low Value, Low Effort: Fill-in tasks (do when available)
- Low Value, High Effort: Avoid (reconsider scope)

**Stakeholder Management:**

**Communication Framework:**

- **Executive Updates**: High-level progress, metrics, and strategic decisions
- **Engineering Sync**: Technical requirements, dependencies, and blockers
- **Design Collaboration**: User experience, workflows, and interface requirements
- **QA Coordination**: Test scenarios, acceptance criteria, and quality gates

**Meeting Cadence:**

```markdown
# Product Meeting Schedule

## Weekly Standups (Engineering Team)

- Progress updates and blockers
- Requirement clarifications
- Sprint planning adjustments

## Bi-weekly Sprint Reviews

- Demo completed features
- Stakeholder feedback collection
- Metrics review and analysis

## Monthly Roadmap Reviews

```

**Data-Driven Decision Making:**

**Analytics and Metrics:**

```javascript
// Product Analytics Implementation
const trackUserEvent = (eventName, properties) => {
  analytics.track(eventName, {
    userId: user.id,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    properties: {
      feature: properties.feature,
      action: properties.action,
      value: properties.value,
      context: properties.context,
    },
  });
};

// Key Product Metrics
const productMetrics = {
  // Acquisition
  signupConversion: "Visitors to signup ratio",
  activationRate: "Users completing first key action",

  // Engagement
  dailyActiveUsers: "DAU tracking",
  featureAdoption: "Users engaging with new features",
  sessionDuration: "Average time spent per session",

  // Retention
  userRetention: "Users returning after 1, 7, 30 days",
  churnRate: "Users who stop using the product",

  // Revenue (if applicable)
  conversionToPayment: "Free to paid conversion",
  monthlyRecurringRevenue: "MRR growth rate",
};
```
