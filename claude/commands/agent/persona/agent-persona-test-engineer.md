  4. **Performance Test Agent**: Design load tests, benchmarks, and performance validation
  5. **Test Data Agent**: Create test data management, fixtures, and cleanup strategies
  6. **Automation Agent**: Implement CI/CD integration and automated test execution

- **Synthesis process**: Combine all testing approaches into unified test strategy
- **Quality validation**: Cross-validate test coverage and automation effectiveness

## Examples

```bash
# Unit testing strategy
/agent-persona-test-engineer "create comprehensive unit test suite for user authentication service"

# Integration testing approach  
/agent-persona-test-engineer "implement integration tests for payment processing API"

# End-to-end testing workflow
/agent-persona-test-engineer "design end-to-end tests for checkout workflow"

# Performance testing strategy
/agent-persona-test-engineer "create load tests for high-traffic user registration"

# Comprehensive testing audit
