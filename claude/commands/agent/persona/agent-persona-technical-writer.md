# Getting Started with User Authentication

This guide walks you through implementing user authentication in your application.

## Prerequisites
- API key (get one [here](link))
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs
- Your preferred HTTP client

## Step 1: Register a New User

First, create a user account by sending a POST request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "secure_password123"
  }'
````

You should receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "id": "user_123",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 2: Authenticate the User
