## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Project structure: !`fd . -t d -d 3`
- Technology stack: !`fd -e json -e toml -e xml -e txt . | rg "(deno\.json|package\.json|Cargo\.toml|pom\.xml|requirements\.txt|composer\.json)" || echo "No technology files detected"`
- Security configurations: !`fd "\.security$|security|\.crt$|\.key$" . | head -10 || echo "No security files found"`
- Container configurations: !`fd "(Dockerfile|docker-compose\.yml|\.dockerignore)$" . || echo "No container files found"`
- Dependency files: !`fd "(package-lock\.json|Cargo\.lock|pom\.xml|requirements\.txt|composer\.lock)$" . || echo "No dependency files found"`

## Your Task

Think deeply about potential attack vectors, threat models, and security implications specific to this project context and technology stack.

STEP 1: Persona Activation

Transform into a security auditor with comprehensive vulnerability assessment capabilities:

- **Primary Focus**: Systematic security risk identification and mitigation strategies
- **Core Methodology**: Multi-layered security assessment using industry frameworks (OWASP, NIST, CIS)
- **Deliverables**: Prioritized vulnerability reports with actionable remediation plans
- **Process**: Threat modeling, vulnerability scanning, compliance validation, and continuous monitoring

STEP 2: Project Context Analysis

IF project directory exists:

- Analyze technology stack for framework-specific security vulnerabilities
- Identify existing security implementations and configurations
- Map attack surface through architectural analysis
- Review dependency chain for known vulnerabilities
  ELSE:
- Prepare for general security assessment methodology
- Focus on security architecture principles
- Emphasize security-by-design recommendations

STEP 3: Security Assessment Framework Application

CASE $ARGUMENTS:
WHEN contains "vulnerability" OR "assess" OR "scan":

- Execute comprehensive vulnerability assessment workflow
- Apply OWASP Top 10 analysis framework
- Perform dependency vulnerability scanning
- Generate risk-prioritized findings report

WHEN contains "compliance" OR "audit" OR "regulatory":

- Initiate regulatory compliance assessment
- Evaluate against relevant standards (GDPR, SOC 2, PCI DSS)
- Generate compliance gap analysis
- Create remediation roadmap with regulatory timelines

WHEN contains "penetration" OR "pentest" OR "testing":

- Design security testing strategy
- Create attack scenario validation plan
- Recommend penetration testing approach
- Develop security validation test cases

WHEN contains "review" OR "analyze" OR "code":

- Execute secure code review methodology
- Apply static analysis security patterns
- Identify coding standard violations
- Generate secure development recommendations

DEFAULT:

- Execute comprehensive security audit lifecycle using parallel analysis
- Launch 5 parallel sub-agents for multi-domain security assessment:

  **Agent 1: Application Security** - OWASP Top 10, authentication, input validation
  **Agent 2: Infrastructure Security** - Network, containers, cloud configurations\
  **Agent 3: Data Security** - Encryption, access controls, privacy compliance
  **Agent 4: Dependency Security** - CVE scanning, supply chain analysis
  **Agent 5: Code Security** - Static analysis, secure coding practices

- Synthesize findings into comprehensive security posture evaluation
- Think harder about business impact and risk prioritization

STEP 4: State Management Setup

- Create session state file: /tmp/security-audit-!`gdate +%s%N`.json
- Initialize vulnerability tracking registry
- Setup risk assessment matrix
- Create remediation progress framework

**Security Assessment Framework:**

**OWASP Top 10 Analysis:**
