Your goal is to analyze strategic decisions through a comprehensive, multi-dimensional evaluation framework.

Ask for the specific decision or problem to analyze if not provided.

## Analysis Requirements

Provide a structured analysis that includes:

- Multiple viable options (3-5 approaches)
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Resource and timeline evaluation
- Risk analysis with mitigation strategies
- Strategic alignment scoring
- Comparative recommendation matrix
- Implementation roadmap

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Problem Definition and Scope

Define the decision context:

- **Problem Statement**: Clear articulation of the decision to be made
- **Analysis Scope**: Determine complexity level (focused vs. comprehensive)
- **Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes a successful outcome
- **Constraints**: Identify technical, resource, and timeline limitations

### Step 2: Multi-Dimensional Analysis

For each viable option, conduct systematic evaluation across four dimensions:

#### Technical Feasibility Analysis

- Implementation complexity and dependencies
- Performance implications and scalability profile
- Integration points and compatibility requirements
- Security considerations and compliance impacts

#### Resource & Timeline Analysis

- **Complexity**: Low/Medium/High with justification
- **Time Estimate**: Realistic timeline (hours/days/weeks/months)
- **Team Requirements**: Solo / Small (2-3) / Medium (4-6) / Large (7+) team
- **Skill Requirements**: Existing vs. new expertise needed
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Ongoing operational requirements

#### Risk Assessment

- Technical risks and failure modes
- Business risks and impact assessment
- Operational risks and mitigation strategies
- Security implications and compliance requirements

#### Strategic Alignment

- Alignment with business goals and architectural principles
- Long-term viability and evolution path
- Team capabilities and organizational fit
- Innovation opportunities vs. proven approaches

### Step 3: Option Evaluation

For each option, provide:

#### Option [N]: [Descriptive Name]

**Overview**: Brief description with architectural context

**Strengths**:

- 3-5 key advantages with business impact
- Specific scenarios where this approach excels

**Trade-offs**:

- 2-4 limitations or risks
- Mitigation strategies for identified risks

**Resource Requirements**:

- Development effort and timeline
- Team expertise and skill requirements
- Infrastructure and tooling needs

### Step 4: Comparative Analysis Matrix

Create a weighted scoring matrix:

| Approach | Complexity | Timeline | Risk Level | Scalability | Maintainability | Strategic Fit | Weighted Score |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Option 1 | Low (3)    | 2d (4)   | Low (4)    | Medium (3)  | High (4)        | High (4)      | 3.6/5.0        |
| Option 2 | High (1)   | 2w (2)   | Med (3)    | High (4)    | Medium (3)      | Medium (3)    | 2.7/5.0        |
| Option 3 | Med (2)    | 1w (3)   | Low (4)    | High (4)    | High (4)        | High (4)      | 3.5/5.0        |

### Step 5: Decision Framework

#### Primary Recommendation

- **Top Choice**: State recommended option with clear rationale
- **Why This Option**: Explain how it best balances all factors
- **Risk Mitigation**: Specific strategies for identified risks
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure successful implementation

#### Fallback Strategy

- **Alternative Approach**: Backup option if primary encounters blockers
- **Switch Triggers**: Clear conditions for changing approaches
- **Transition Strategy**: How to pivot with minimal sunk costs

#### Critical Decision Points

- **Validation Checkpoints**: Key moments requiring stakeholder input
- **Go/No-Go Gates**: Timeline and resource confirmation points
- **Escalation Triggers**: When to involve additional stakeholders

### Step 6: Implementation Roadmap

#### Immediate Next Steps (0-2 weeks)

- [ ] Validation tasks for chosen approach
- [ ] Resource allocation and team assignment
- [ ] Risk mitigation setup
- [ ] Technical proof-of-concept definition

#### Medium-term Milestones (2-8 weeks)

- [ ] Implementation phases with deliverables
- [ ] Integration testing and validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Documentation and knowledge transfer

#### Long-term Considerations (2+ months)

- [ ] Maintenance strategy and operational procedures
- [ ] Scaling plan and capacity requirements
- [ ] Evolution roadmap and future enhancements

## Decision-Making Guidelines

### Objective Evaluation Criteria

- **Quantifiable Metrics**: Base recommendations on measurable factors
- **Business Value**: Consider both technical debt and business impact
- **Team Capability**: Account for expertise and learning curve
- **Timeline Realism**: Factor in constraints and dependencies

### Context Considerations

- **Project Phase**: MVP vs. growth vs. optimization vs. maintenance
- **Team Composition**: Size, skills, and experience level
- **Organizational Constraints**: Approval processes and compliance
- **Technology Alignment**: Stack compatibility and architectural fit

### Balanced Trade-offs

- **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Implementation cost vs. maintenance overhead
- **Innovation vs. Proven**: Cutting-edge vs. battle-tested approaches
- **Internal vs. External**: Build vs. buy vs. partner decisions
- **Perfection vs. Pragmatism**: Technical excellence vs. delivery speed

## Output Format

Deliver a structured analysis document containing:

1. **Executive Summary**: Key recommendation with supporting rationale
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Full evaluation of all options
3. **Comparison Matrix**: Quantitative scoring across all dimensions
4. **Implementation Plan**: Actionable roadmap with milestones
5. **Risk Register**: Identified risks with mitigation strategies
