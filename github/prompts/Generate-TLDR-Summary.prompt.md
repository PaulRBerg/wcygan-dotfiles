Your goal is to generate concise, actionable TL;DR summaries with progressive disclosure for any content type.

Ask for the target content (file path, directory, or topic) if not provided.

## Requirements

- Create three levels of detail: 30-second, 2-minute, and 5-minute versions
- Focus on actionable insights and immediate next steps
- Adapt format based on content type (technical, documentation, project, or discussion)
- Use clear hierarchy with most important information first
- Include concrete next steps and critical warnings

## Context Files

Include relevant files from your project to understand the structure and content. Examples:

**Project Overview**: Include files that provide project context

- README.md
- package.json (Node.js projects)
- deno.json (Deno projects)
- Cargo.toml (Rust projects)
- go.mod (Go projects)

**Documentation**: Include files that contain the content to summarize

- docs/ directory
- src/ directory (for code analysis)
- Any specific files mentioned by the user

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Content Analysis

Analyze the provided content to understand:

- **Content type**: File, directory, codebase, documentation, or discussion topic
- **Complexity level**: Simple, moderate, or complex
- **Target audience**: Technical, business, or mixed
- **Key information hierarchy**: Critical vs. supporting details

### Step 2: Strategy Selection

Based on content type, apply appropriate summarization approach:

- **Technical/Code**: Focus on functionality, architecture, and implementation
- **Documentation**: Extract key insights and actionable recommendations
- **Project/Feature**: Emphasize goals, status, risks, and next steps
- **Discussion/Meeting**: Highlight decisions, action items, and open questions

### Step 3: Progressive Disclosure Generation

Create three levels of detail:

1. **30-Second Version**: Absolute essentials only
2. **2-Minute Version**: Key points with minimal context
3. **5-Minute Version**: Complete overview with full details

2. [Configuration requirement]
3. [First thing to run/test]

## Common Issues

- [Most frequent problem and fix]
- [Performance consideration]

## Who to Ask

- [Documentation location]
```

### For Documentation Content

```markdown
# TL;DR: [Document Name]

## Main Message

[Core thesis or argument in one sentence]

## Key Takeaways

- [Most important insight]
- [Critical fact or data point]
- [Actionable recommendation]

## Implementation

1. [First step to apply this knowledge]
2. [How to measure success]

## Skip This If

- [When this doesn't apply]
- [Prerequisites not met]
```

### For Project/Feature Content

```markdown
# TL;DR: [Project Name]

## Goal

[What we're trying to achieve]

## Status

## Timeline

- [Key milestone dates]
```

## Quality Requirements

- **Brevity**: Maximum 5 bullet points per section
